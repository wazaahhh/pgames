\caption{Migration diagram for focal player on site with payoff $1.3$ (defector on crossed site). The best site in the migration range has highest payoff ($1.3 \times 4 = 5.2$) for a defector, which is the strategy of the focal player. The site with highest payoff is occupied by a cooperative player and may be expelled with probability $s$ (orange arrow). In this case, the player on the target site is forced to move to the nearest empty site with payoff $2$ (black arrow). However, with probability $1-s$, the target player moves to the empty site with payoff ($2.6$) than the payoff at the focal site.}

At initialization ($t=0$), there is a $50\%$ chance that a player will cooperate (resp. defect). The uneven landscapes reflect the statistical fluctuations of simulations. For all values of $M$, the cooperation exhibits a sharp drop for $d > d^*$  and $s > s^*$ with $(d^*,s^*)$ being a function of $M$. For high grid density ($d > 0.9$), cooperation cannot be sustained even with low property violation. As the migration range gets large $M > 9$ , the area of sustainable cooperation shrinks drastically.%(see SI Section \ref{SI:d09} for further details on {\it migration} and {\it property} games in densely populated worlds).

\caption{Phase transition of cooperation levels for migration Moore's distances $M = \{1,2,3,5,11\}$ and population density $d=0.5$. For all migration ranges, a tiny level of property violation $s < 0.5\%$ enhances cooperation, while more property violation decreases cooperation. For $M=1$, cooperation decreases continuously as property violation grows (up to  $s = 2\%$), For larger migration ranges, cooperation exhibits a sharp drop beyond a critical threshold $s^{*}$, and as $M$ increases, $s^{*}$ becomes a range of values, represented by color areas of $1^{st}$ to $99^{th}$ confidence intervals, where cooperation can either be sustained at high level ($c>0.8$), or collapse in a chaotic way (regardless of the initial grid configuration). For instance, the critical phase transition range for $M=11$ (yellow area) is $ 5.8\% < s^{*} < 7\%$. While the outcome can either be high cooperation level or collapse, the probability of high cooperation decreases within each range critical phase transition range (c.f., continuous lines within areas): Hence, it becomes more likely that cooperation will collapse as property violation reaches the upper band of the critical phase transition range. {\bf [it's unclear why this probability is not decreasing in a monotonic way for $M=11$. It's probably a detail, but I think it's a genuine behavior.]}}

\caption{Payoff differences over time from property violation (blue), forced migration following property violation (green), success-driven migration (red), and strategy update (cyan). The top panels show sustained cooperation and $s = \{0.03,0.037,0.042,\}$ resp. outside, at lower and higher limits of the transition range (c.f., Figure \ref{fig:phase_transition}{\bf c}) for $M=5$: In all these case, a dynamic equilibrium is reached quickly and high levels of cooperation ($c > 0.9$). The bottom panels show the unstainable dynamics for same values of property violation at the edge of the phase transition range $s = \{0.037,0.042\}$ and for $s = 0.05$. What makes a difference between sustainable and unsustainable dynamics seems to be related to how fast the delta payoff from property violation can be reduced to a level ( $<2$) at which the combined (positive) effects of migration and strategy update seem to offset the negative effects of property violation. If this dynamic equilibrium is not met, the payoff resulting from strategy updates increases, reflecting the increased adoption of {\it defector} strategies. As a result, property violation does not payoff anymore, leading to unsustainable dynamics and collapse of cooperation.}

As the migration range increases,  larger clusters form when cooperators (see {\it B.,E.}) or defectors (see {\it D.,G.}) win.

%\caption{Typical phase transitions for migration ranges $1 \leqslant M \leqslant 24$ ($0.4 \leqslant d < 0.6$). When there is no property violation $s = 0$, cooperators invade the world for any migration range $M > 0$. For small $M = \{ 1,3,5\}$, a sharp phase transition occurs at a transition point $s^{*}$, from a high level of cooperators in the populations ($c > 0.6$) when $s < s^{*}$ to entire collapse of cooperators for $s > s^{*}$. For $M \leqslant 5$, there is no intermediary state, whereas for $M \geqslant 7$, an intermediary state appears defined by $s^{*}_{-} < s < s^{*}_{+}$, with populations of cooperators in minority ($c \approx 0.45 < 0.5$) compared to defectors. For $M= \{ 7,9\}$, there is a non-zero probability of cooperation collapse, while for larger migration ranges ($M \geqslant 11$), this intermediary state becomes more stable, i.e., process converges almost surely  {\bf [to be further checked]}. Larger migration ranges increase both the maximum number of cooperators when $0 < s < s^{*}_{-}$, increase the lower $s^{*}_{-}$ and higher $s^{*}_{+}$ bounds of property violations, below (resp. above) which cooperative populations win (resp. disappear), and decreases the minimum average proportion of cooperative populations needed in order for cooperation to strive {\bf [to be further checked]}.}
