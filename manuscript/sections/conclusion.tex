\section*{Conclusion}
The {\it property game} is a mobility game, which implies that with some probability $s$ a player can be can expelled from her site. In general, property violation heavily undermines cooperation and the collapse of cooperation is associated with a sharp phase transition (Figure \ref{fig:phase_transitions}), which becomes smoother as the migration range $M$ gets larger.\\

But in some circumstances, cooperation may be maintained as a majority strategy even for large $s$. The main condition is the migration range of players, which is equal to the migration range of property violators: As the migration range $M$ gets large enough $M > ??$ cooperation remains the dominant strategy ( Figure \ref{fig:cooperation_M}) {\bf [yet with some increased volatility?]}.\\

The function $c(M,d,s,i=N)$ governing the probability of cooperation remains unclear, but we could study the edge of the phase transition for $M>7$ (see Figure \ref{fig:configurations} {\bf g.})
