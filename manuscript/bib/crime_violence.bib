  abstract = {Imagine that the neighborhood you are living in is covered with graffiti, litter, and unreturned shopping carts. Would this reality cause you to litter more, trespass, or even steal? A thesis known as the broken windows theory suggests that signs of disorderly and petty criminal behavior trigger more disorderly and petty criminal behavior, thus causing the behavior to spread. This may cause neighborhoods to decay and the quality of life of its inhabitants to deteriorate. For a city government, this may be a vital policy issue. But does disorder really spread in neighborhoods? So far there has not been strong empirical support, and it is not clear what constitutes disorder and what may make it spread. We generated hypotheses about the spread of disorder and tested them in six field experiments. We found that, when people observe that others violated a certain social norm or legitimate rule, they are more likely to violate other norms or rules, which causes disorder to spread.}

  abstract = {This DataWatch estimates the costs and monetary value of lost quality of life due to death and nonfatal physical and psychological injury resulting from violent crime. In 1987 physical injury to people age twelve and older resulting from rape, robbery, assault, murder, and arson caused about $10 billion in potential health-related costs, including some unmet mental health care needs. It led to $23 billion in lost productivity and almost $145 billion in reduced quality of life (in 1989 dollars). If associated deaths and cases resulting in psychological injury only are included, costs average $47,000 for rape, $19,000 for robbery, $15,000 for assault, and $25,000 for arson. Considering only survivors with physical injury, rape cost $60,000, robberies $25,000, assaults $22,000, and arson $50,000. Costs are almost $2.4 million per murder. Lifetime costs for all intentional injuries totaled $178 billion during 1987-1990. }

  abstract = {This chapter traces and evaluates both the historic emergence of the modern ùpreventive turnù as well as the elaboration and institutionalisation of crime prevention and community safety over the last thirty years or so. Focusing on the UK, the evolution and changes over time are situated, where relevant, in a broader international context. The chapter identifies three distinct periods of developments that structure the shifts in crime prevention policy and practices from the 1980s to the present day. It explores the conceptualisation, take-up and advancement of a preventive mentality and practices in relation to situational, social and developmental crime prevention as well as community safety. It goes on to assess the institutionalisation of preventive partnerships and early intervention as distinct forms of governance and their implications for ùresponsibilisationù and ùsecuritisationù. In conclusion, it reflects upon the journey travelled thus far as well as possible future directions in an age of austerity.}

  abstract = {This paper analyzes gated communities in a geographic model of crime. There are four major results. First, gating always diverts crime to other communities but has an overall deterrent effect on crime as long as it does not impact legitimate employment opportunities. Second, gating expenditures may be strategic substitutes or strategic complements. The latter possibility may help explain why gated communities appear to spread like a contagion. Third, the Nash equilibrium level of gating expenditures is inefficiently large. Fourth, gating may actually increase the overall level of crime if it either affects employment opportunities or it influences the selection among multiple equilibrium crime rates.}

  abstract = {As communities become more urbanized, there is concern about a decline in sense of community and an increase in fear of crime. Developers are creating gated communities to reverse this trend, but their success remains unknown. This research empirically addresses the issues of sense of community, crime, and fear of crime in a comparative study of two gated and two nongated communities with similar attributes. Mail surveys were conducted in both a gated and a nongated community in two contexts: public housing and high-income suburban communities. Results showed that high-income gated community residents reported a significantly lower sense of community, significantly higher perceived personal safety and comparative community safety, and no significant difference in actual crime rate as compared to their nongated counterparts. In the low-income communities, there were no significant differences between the gated and nongated communities on any of the measures. Implications of creating gated communities in different economic contexts are discussed.}

  publisher={Zed Books London},
  abstract = {Two decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, why are leading democracies like the United States, India, and Israel building massive walls and fences on their borders? Despite predictions of a borderless world through globalization, these three countries alone have built an astonishing total of 5,700 kilometers of security barriers. In this groundbreaking work, Reece Jones analyzes how these controversial border security projects were justified in their respective countries, what consequences these physical barriers have on the lives of those living in these newly securitized spaces, and what long-term effects the hardening of political borders will have in these societies and globally. Border Walls is a bold, important intervention that demonstrates that the exclusion and violence necessary to secure the borders of the modern state often undermine the very ideals of freedom and democracy the barriers are meant to protect. Border Walls won the 2013 Julian Minghi Outstanding Research Award presented at the American Association of Geographers annual meeting. The award is presented for a book that makes an innovative, original contribution to political geography.}

  year={2003},
  publisher={Springer},
  abstract= {This article presents a roadmap of emerging legal problems in the area of Digital Rights Management (DRM). It argues against adopting fundamentalist viewpoints in the DRM policy debate. In particular, DRM technology is much more flexible than many DRM critics acknowledge. The article covers various problems that are less frequently discussed in legal and policy circles. It analyzes the relationship between DRM, fair use, and innovation, using rights locker architectures, dynamic DRM systems, the Creative Commons project, DRM technology license agreements, and security research as examples. It addresses the alleged dichotomy between DRM and copyright levy systems as well as the implications of DRM for privacy protection. By analyzing various technology platforms, it describes the implications DRM has for competition in platform markets as well as in complementary aftermarkets. Finally, the article assesses recent efforts to standardize DRM technology, both by the private sector (in particular TCPA and Palladium), and by the legislature.}

  author={Burk, Dan L},
  journal={Fordham L. Rev.},
  volume={74},
  pages={537},
  year={2005},
  publisher={HeinOnline},
  abstract = {This paper examines certain social costs of deploying digital rights management or DRM systems to protect copyrighted content. The calculus of costs and benefits for such technical self-help is highly complex, and the prospect for successful self-help via such measures is uncertain due to the deterministic nature of the technical design. DRM systems essentially provide an automated alternative to legal protections such as copyright. But because it is impossible to program complex situational responses into DRM systems, DRM constitutes the equivalent of a legal rule, rather than a legal standard. Thus the literature on rules and standards is useful in evaluating the effects of DRM deployment. As this literature would predict, DRM shifts discretion away from the user, toward the producer, and DRM design therefore resembles legal rule making rather than legal standard setting. Previous analyses of rules and standards suggests that rules are preferable when the costs of ex ante decision-making will be lower than the costs of ex post discretion and adjudication. Ex ante DRM design decisions by content producers are also likely to be driven by the character of the technology. At the same time that DRM stands in for a legal rule, it also comprises a technical standard. For reasons of interoperability and trust management, DRM will tend to converge on a single standard. This means that DRM will tend toward a type of technological monoculture, presenting opportunities for the standards owner to engage in anti-competitive market distortions. This result will tend to be reinforced by legal anti-circumvention measures, a trend already apparent in the employment of the DMCA in some court decisions. However, more recent appellate decisions seem determined to resist this result, employing statutory re-interpretation and the threat of anti-competition sanctions to reverse the worst effects of DRM market distortion. }
