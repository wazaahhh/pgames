  abstract = {Mysmenopsis furtiva, a tiny spider which lives in the funnelwebs of the Jamaicandiplurid spider, Ischnothele xera, behaves both as a kleptoparasite and as a commensal;it pilfers portions of its host's prey and also captures and consumes minute insect swhich are trapped in the host web and unnoticed or ignored by the host . Mysmenopsisfurtiva is able to ingest hemolymph from its host's prey at a much faster rate than it caningest material from the insects it captures . Two of its stealth strategies are to move not atall or slowly when the host is motionless and to synchronize its rapid movements with hos tmovements . The host's anti-kleptoparasite behaviors suggest that the kleptoparasite has asignificant negative impact on the host .}
